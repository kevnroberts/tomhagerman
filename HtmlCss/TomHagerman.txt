info
 I was in music school for violin. In college I played bass guitar in a goth band I started playing piano at around six or seven. I switched to violin at age nine because they still had orchestras in elementary schools at that point. I played in the youth symphony, kept it up in high school— because they still had orchestra programs in the high school— I went to the University of Colorado for violin. I played in the Boulder Philharmonic for a bit and played in a relatively unsuccessful goth band in college basically until I ended up in a summer program at Disney World playing violin at Epcot Center - I started playing with DeVotchKa when I returned in the fall. I moved to New York City after college and took violin lessons out there discovered an accordion in a pawn shop— I became disillusioned with it all and ended back up in DeVotchKa. I'm just excited that the symphony is game to experiment with all of us in the Denver musical landscape. I hope they know that there is a lot of love and respect for the Colorado Symphony coming from the rock and roll community in Denver.
